Wander_Wallet_NS6: Tour Budget Visualizer
WanderWallet is a full-stack client-server application designed to provide travelers with an instant, visual breakdown of their trip expenses. It bridges the gap between complex logistical planning and user-friendly design by combining real-time data processing with interactive visualizations.
🚀 Features
 * Request-Response Architecture: Uses a Python Flask backend to handle logic and an HTML/JS frontend for the user interface.
 * Real-time Calculations: Processes distance, number of members, and tour duration against "pretrained" values for fuel efficiency and daily costs.
 * Dynamic Visualizations: Generates five interactive chart types (Bar, Pie, Doughnut, Polar Area, and Line) using Chart.js to help users understand their spending weight.
 * Modern Glassmorphism UI: Features a sleek, semi-transparent frosted glass design with vibrant linear gradients and glowing interactive elements.
 * Intro Animations: Professional scale-and-blur entrance animations for a polished first impression.

🛠️ Tech Stack

 * Backend: Python (Flask)
 * Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Animations), JavaScript (ES6+)
 * Data Visualization: Chart.js
 * Communication: Asynchronous JSON data exchange via Fetch API

📐 Math Logic

The application uses specific real-world variables stored securely on the server:
 * Fuel Expense: Calculated as \frac{Distance}{Efficiency} \times Fuel Price.
 * Accommodation: Automatically calculates costs based on nights stayed (e.g., ₹0 for same-day returns).
 * Rates: * Bike: 30 km/liter at ₹109.52/liter.
   * Car: 11 km/liter at ₹101.32/liter.
   * Daily Costs: ₹270 for food and ₹700 for accommodation per person.

└── templates/          # MUST be named exactly 'templates'
    └── index.html      # The Client (HTML/JS)

2. Setup
 * Open the project folder in VS Code.
 * Install Flask via the terminal:
   pip install flask

3. Run
